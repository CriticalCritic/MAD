Mobile App Development

For a Mobile App Development class, CS153A, at Brandeis, I was tasked to create a Final Project in a limited time frame. I made An Organization App: a simple, free, and open-source project that lets the user organize their ideas using the easy-to-use app user interface. There are directions on the first page that opens, the "Info" page, to guide the user to the first step of uploading an image from their device. From there, the option of adding original thoughts through a caption of any length is given. On the "Organize" page, the user can view added elements and edit them by either pressing on their image to be navigated to a separate page to focus on it or edit the caption where it is. All added pieces are stored on the device through asynchronous storage, as are modified settings to keep aspects like dark made still on through app closures. 
Light mode is discouraged as navigating to the "Organize" tab while light mode is enabled will set the device screen to maximum brightness. This gives a chance for users to change their preferences in the settings before being blinded. 

The folder CS153AQuizzes contains the quizzes I completed for the first half of the class. Each quiz either consists of its own component or a folder in the components folder.
